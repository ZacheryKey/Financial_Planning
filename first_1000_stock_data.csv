As a result of such reclassification, the difference between the fair value of the 5% cumulative preferred stock and its carrying amount is required to be recorded as an adjustment to paid-in capital, which is added to or deducted from net earnings available to common shareholders in the calculation of earnings per share. In connection with the reclassification of BFC's 5% cumulative preferred stock, earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 was adjusted to reflect a decrease in equity of approximately $0.5 million.

As a result of such reclassification, the difference between the fair value of the 5% cumulative preferred stock and its carrying amount is required to be recorded as an adjustment to paid-in capital, which is added to or deducted from net earnings available to common shareholders in the calculation of earnings per share. In connection with the reclassification of BFC's 5% cumulative preferred stock, earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 was adjusted to reflect a decrease in equity of approximately $0.5 million.
